# MAM — Client Website (Freelance Project)

This repository contains a **custom-built, production-ready website** developed as a **freelance project for a client**. The focus of this project was to deliver a clean, responsive, and maintainable frontend aligned with real-world business requirements.

## 🧠 Project Overview

MAM is a multi-page static website designed to clearly communicate the client’s services while maintaining strong performance, accessibility, and visual consistency across devices.

The project was built from the ground up using modern frontend best practices, with careful attention to structure, scalability, and UX details.

## 🛠️ My Role

As the **sole frontend developer**, I was responsible for:

- Translating design concepts into clean, semantic HTML
- Building a responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Organizing assets and styles for long-term maintainability
- Implementing interactive UI behavior using JavaScript
- Ensuring visual consistency across all pages
- Optimizing page structure for performance and clarity

## 💡 Key Development Highlights

- **Semantic HTML5** for accessibility and SEO
- **Responsive CSS** with consistent spacing, typography, and layout behavior
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for lightweight interactivity (no unnecessary frameworks)
